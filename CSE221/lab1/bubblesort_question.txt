# question 05
Here is the code of bubble sort. Its run time complexity is θ(n2).
Change the code in a way so that its time complexity is θ(n) for the best-case scenario. 
You are not allowed to use any builtin sort function to solve this problem.

def bubbleSort(arr):                                                    
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        for j in range(len(arr)-i-1): 
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]


Input
In the first line, you will be given N (1≤N≤105). Then you will be given an array a of N integers (1≤ai≤109) that you have to sort in increasing order. It is guaranteed that if the original input array is not in the best case scenario, 1≤N≤1000


Output
Output the sorted array (Please see the sample output for reference)
