You are given an array of N integers and an integer K. Your task is to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to K.

Input
The first line contains two integers N (1≤N≤105) and K (1≤K≤109) — the size of the array and the maximum allowed sum.

The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,a3…an (1≤ai≤106) — the elements of the array.

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to K.

Note
In the first example, possible subarrays with sum less than or equal to 4 are [4],[1],[2],[1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2,1]. Among them, the longest size is 3.

In the second example, sum of the entire array is 5. Hence, we can take the whole array.

In the third example, no subarray has sum less than or equal to 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
