You are given a 2D grid with R
 rows and H
 columns.

Each cell in the grid is one of the following:

.
 — Empty cell: You can move into this cell.
D
 — Cell with a diamond: You can move into this cell and collect the diamond.
#
 — Obstacle: You cannot move into this cell.
You may start from any non-obstacle cell and move in the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Your goal is to choose a starting cell such that you can collect the maximum number of diamonds

Input
The first line contains two integers R
 and H
 (1≤R,H≤1000)
 — the number of rows and columns of the grid. The next R
 lines each contain H
 characters, describing the grid.

Output
Print a single integer — the maximum number of diamonds you can collect starting from a valid cell.
