You are given a directed unweighted graph with N
 nodes and M
 edges. The nodes are numbered from 1
 to N
. The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges.

Write a code to find if there is any cycle in the graph. In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal. [Wikipedia]

Input
The first line contains four integers N
 and M
 (1≤N≤2×105,1≤M≤2×105)
 — the number of vertices and total number of edges.

The next M
 lines will contain two integers ui,vi(1≤ui,vi≤N)
 — denoting there is an edge from city ui
 to city vi
.

Output
Print YES if the graph contains any cycle, otherwise print NO.
