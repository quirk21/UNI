you are given an array A of size N. You have to choose two indices i and j such that 1≤i<j≤N and A[i]+A[j]2 is the maximum possible. Here, we are considering 1-based indexing. Come up with a divide and conquer approach to solve the problem.

Input
The first line contains an integer N (2≤N≤105) — denoting the length of the list.

In the next line, there will be N integers A1,A2,A3…An (−109≤Ai≤109) separated by spaces.

Output
Print a single integer - which denotes the maximum possible value of A[i]+A[j]2
