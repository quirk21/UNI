# question 04Your friend is trying to solve the following problem. You are given T test cases. For each test case, you are given an integer N
You have to find out the summation of 1 to N.

Your friend wrote the following Python code to solve it:

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        sum += i
    print(sum)
However, the code is not passing the online judge due to some unknown errors for large values of N.

Since you are currently studying CSE221 and have learned about time complexity, help your friend come up with a more efficient solution.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤104) — the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain a single integer N (1≤N≤106).

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the summation from 1 to N.
