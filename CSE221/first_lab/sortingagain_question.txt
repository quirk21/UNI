# question 06
Suppose you are given a task to rank the students. You have gotten the marks and ID of the students. Now your task is to rank the students based on their marks using a sorting algorithm. If two or more students get the same mark, then students with the lower ID will get prioritized. See the input and output for a better understanding.

However, you have to keep in mind that your sorting algorithms perform the minimum number of swapping operations.

Input
The first line of the input file will contain an integer N(1≤N≤1000). The second line will contain N integers, representing the Student ID, Si(1≤Si≤1000)
The next line will contain the N integers, Sm(1≤Sm≤1000), which denotes the obtained mark of the corresponding students.

Note: It is guaranteed that the student IDs are unique. In other words, Si≠Sj if i≠j.

Output
The first line of the output must contain a number X
which denotes the number of minimum swaps. The rest of the N
lines will contain the Student ID and obtained marks sorted based on the instruction above. See the sample output for a better understanding.

Important Note: Since you are asked to minimize the number of swaps, if your number of swaps doesn't match with the judge's answer, your solution will be considered incorrect.

Look at the first sample input. It can be shown that this can be sorted with only 4 swaps. 
It can also be shown that it is not possible to sort this in less than 4 swaps.
